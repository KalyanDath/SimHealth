## Centralized Hospital Record Management

The process of keeping patient information in different health facilities in a particular
country leads to data redundancy and also affects the time it takes for a physician to attend to a
patient when they first visit. Thus, the project aims to implement a centralized data management
system. A centralized system helps to reduce the risk of errors and improves the accuracy of the
data. It also helps to reduce the cost of maintaining multiple systems. There are also many
problems when scheduling an appointment with the doctor, such as patients having to wait in
long queues.
